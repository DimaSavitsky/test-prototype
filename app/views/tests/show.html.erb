  <h3>Instructions</h3>

  <p>Stick to timings &#8211; it&#8217;s very important. If you get stuck don&#8217;t panic, take a deep breath and move onto the next question. It&#8217;s important to remember that the easiest questions aren&#8217;t always at the start of the assessment. Psychometric test assessment are not typically negatively marked so you might want to consider taking a best guess and calmly progressing through the assessment. Many test publishers allow you to flag questions and go back and review them at the end of the assessment &#8211; if this functionality is available then it should be described in the instructions presented at the start of the assessment.</p>

  <p>After clicking &#8220;start test&#8221; your assessment will begin. If you have read the instructions carefully then the format of the question shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise. Spend a couple of seconds familiarising yourself with the context of the question.</p>

  <p>Next read the first question carefully ensuring that you spend sufficient time making sure you understand what the question is asking.</p>
