It&#8217;s important to remember that the easiest questions aren&#8217;t always at the start of the assessment.

  <p>After clicking &#8220;start test&#8221; your assessment will begin. If you have read the instructions carefully then the format of the question shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise. Spend a couple of seconds familiarising yourself with the context of the question.</p>

  <p>Next read the first question carefully ensuring that you spend sufficient time making sure you understand what the question is asking.</p>
